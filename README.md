# ComicCollector
Final Capstone for tracking user's comic collection using Marvel API

Leverages c# in .NET/ASP framework with Angular front-end to allow users to search for comics, and add them to their collection saved in my custom API.  

I wanted to set it up to get experience with calling an API from the backend, although the user experience is the same as if calling the external API from the front-end.
